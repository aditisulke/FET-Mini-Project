                <h4> Kittens</h4><br>
                A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally
                dependent on their mother for survival. They do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten
                days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest.
                After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens
                are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.

                <h4> Puppies</h4><br>
                A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (1-3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to
                7–11 kg (15-23 lb). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the
                puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers
                specifically to young dogs,[1] while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes,
                guinea pigs, rats or sharks.

                <h4>Bunnies</h4><br>
                Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the
                pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305
                breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of
                cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is
                familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.
                With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the
                world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
